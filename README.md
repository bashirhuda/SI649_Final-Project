# The Disproportionate Impact of Medical Debt in the United States

  In recent years, the cost of healthcare has also become a significant barrier to accessing care, with many individuals delaying or forgoing necessary medical services due to high costs (Rakshit et al., 2023). Healthcare costs are a significant reason several Americans are not receiving the care that they need. Studies have been looking at medical debt as a social determinant of health. One looked at data in 2020 and found that the average medical debt in the US is $429. Unlike secured wealth (e.g., a mortgage), medical debt does not help people build wealth and can have long term consequences, such as impacting one’s credit score (Mendes De Leon & Griggs 2021, Levey, N 2022). Economic opportunity impacts things like intergenerational social mobility and health, which also suggests generational lasting impacts on health of medical debt (Katikireddi 2016).

  Our results found that marginalized populations have disproportionately higher burdens of medical debt. This includes marginalized communities like women and Black Americans, but also includes regions such as the south where there is a higher percentage of individuals in poverty (Kurtzleben 2014).

  Furthermore, individuals aged between 36-65 also have a disproportionately higher burden of medical debt. This is also concerning given that these are individuals who are tasked with having to save for their future through retirement funds and investments, yet are struggling to maintain financial stability.

These visualizations reinforce the impact of structural sexism,systemic racism on the health outcomes of minorities and the importance of considering social determinants of health for interventions. Further research is needed to better understand the factors contributing to these disparities and to identify effective policies to address them.
